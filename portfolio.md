# My Projects

## Programming
### Beat Saber Everywhere
In the never ending journey to quenchy my evergrowing love for Beat Saber while not owning the equipment to do so, I attempt to satisfy these needs by producing ports to different platforms. After recreating this masterpiece of a game in a the Nintendo Labo's garage, I found this was not enough. As part of a hack week Discord hosted in the summer of 2019, I found my chance to produce playable version inside of Discord.

### Discord Bot for Role Automation
A Discord bot I created for the LSU Computer Society's Discord server. It allows members to assign theirselves roles that allows then to get notificatino abou the game role when people want to play. Also contains administrative features like a mass role wiper.

### Web-based Interacable Overlay for Streams

### Event-wide, weekend-long Streaming Infrastructure 
Infrastructure set up over a LAN hall which utilises NDI to locally stream to a computer which deals with the master stream to Twitch. These "microstreams" can be turned on and off from anywhere durning the event and will not affect the uptime of the master stream. Allows for persistence of stream but grants the flexibility of showing off every part of our LAN events.

### Custom Scene Collection Installer
I made an executable applicatino that will install the societies assets to the members OBS Scene Collection folder. Allows users to use our brand and overlay scheme when they streamed on our behalf.
