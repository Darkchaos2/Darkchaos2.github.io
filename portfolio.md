# My Projects

There are some of the publicly available project I have worked on and that I am proud of! This is not an exhaustive list as some projects are private. You can find more about these projects on my CV.

## Programming
### Beat Saber Everywhere
In the never ending journey to quench my ever growing love for Beat Saber while not owning the equipment to do so, I attempt to satisfy these needs by producing ports to different platforms. After recreating this masterpiece of a game in the Nintendo Labo's garage, I found this was not enough. As part of a hack week Discord hosted in the summer of 2019, I found my chance to further fulfill my dreams by producing a playable version of Beat Saber inside of Discord.

### Discord Bot for Role Automation
A Discord bot I created for the LSU Computer Society's Discord server. It allows members to assign themselves roles that allows then to get notification about the game role when people want to play. Also contains administrative features like a mass role wiper.

### Web-based Intractable Overlay for Streams
[See Intractable Tournament Stream Overlay](#intractable-tournament-stream-overlay)

## Streaming | LSU Video Game Society
### Event-wide, weekend-long Streaming Infrastructure 
Infrastructure set up over a LAN hall which utilises NDI to locally stream to a computer which deals with the master stream to Twitch. These "micro-streams" can be turned on and off from anywhere during the event and will not affect the uptime of the master stream. Allows for persistence of stream but grants the flexibility of showing off every part of our LAN events.

### Immersive VR User Experience
Green screen set up with a virtual reality headset to be able to capture footage of members being inside of the games they play at our events.

### Intractable Tournament Stream Overlay
I created this nodecg based web-overlay to allow viewers of the stream to follow the current progression of our Smash tournaments. It also allows for dynamic changing of settings like player names and scores. This does this all seamlessly using animations. It also auto-scales names, for those players who are fixated on using ridiculously long usernames.

### Custom Scene Collection Installer
I made an executable application that will install the societies assets to the members OBS Scene Collection folder. Allows users to use our brand and overlay scheme when they streamed on our behalf.

## Video Editing
### Society Trailer | LSU Video Game Society
Worked alongside the Media Officer to produce a new trailer for our society. I focused on the timings, transitions and audio syncing of the project.

### Personal Channel
I like to edit videos, whether that be to make people laugh with memes or to make something that looks cool like montages or showcases.

A good mix of the sort of things I edit is my channel trailer. This contains edits such as the use of motion tracking to inject objects into scenes, use of fluid camera movement and just funny moments I have recorded over my life.

One thing which I am proud of, which I originally didn't think I would be able to achieve, is the falling polaroid section at the end of my Spaltoon 2 look back video.
This tries to mimic the dropping pattern of falling polaroid photos with the use of bezier curves, ease in and ease out keyframes. Although not perfect, I am still quite proud of the outcome.
