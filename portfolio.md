# My Projects

## Programming
### Beat Saber Everywhere
In the never ending journey to quench my ever growing love for Beat Saber while not owning the equipment to do so, I attempt to satisfy these needs by producing ports to different platforms. After recreating this masterpiece of a game in a the Nintendo Labo's garage, I found this was not enough. As part of a hack week Discord hosted in the summer of 2019, I found my chance to produce playable version inside of Discord.

### Discord Bot for Role Automation
A Discord bot I created for the LSU Computer Society's Discord server. It allows members to assign themselves roles that allows then to get notification about the game role when people want to play. Also contains administrative features like a mass role wiper.

### Web-based Intractable Overlay for Streams

## Streaming | LSU Video Game Society
### Event-wide, weekend-long Streaming Infrastructure 
Infrastructure set up over a LAN hall which utilises NDI to locally stream to a computer which deals with the master stream to Twitch. These "micro-streams" can be turned on and off from anywhere during the event and will not affect the uptime of the master stream. Allows for persistence of stream but grants the flexibility of showing off every part of our LAN events.

### Immersive VR User Experience
Green screen set up with a virtual reality headset to be able to capture footage of members being inside of the games they play at our events.

### Custom Scene Collection Installer
I made an executable application that will install the societies assets to the members OBS Scene Collection folder. Allows users to use our brand and overlay scheme when they streamed on our behalf.

## Video Editing | LSU Video Game Society
### Society Trailer
Worked alongside the Media Officer to produce a new trailer for our society. I focused on the timings, transitions and audio syncing of the project.
